Approch: 

   1. make storage of ((requirment size) * (blocks size)).
   2. traverse that 
      -  if any requirment is already true so make that 0 in storage
      -  else find in one index back & forward and put minimum of them
   3. make new array and for ith index store total distance travel from ith block to 
      complete requirment.    


DRY RUN :

step1: 
     - make recored array 
     - initialize it with ((reqs.size) * (blocks.size)) INT_MAX .
step2:
    - traverse left to right on block 
       > if at ith block requirment is true store 0 (as no distance is travel by us to full fill requirment)
       > else store minimum distance travel by (i-1)th block for that requirment
    - traverse right to left on block 
       > Store minimum of (i+1)th block & ith block for same requirment
step3:
    - decleare new array result 
    - Store ith index with total distance travel from ith block to complete all requirment.
step4: 
    - return index which have minimum value
